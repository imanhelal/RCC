To run our code first:

    (1) run Simulating Events
        Using Visual Studio - choose the event log file to replay its run.
	Specify the output folder inside the monitoring package in (2)
    (2) run __int__.py in monitorDB using python 3.1 , with arguments
        Heuristic data in (.csv) format
        Ranking score threshold

The output is stored in a database file inside MonitorDB folder.
